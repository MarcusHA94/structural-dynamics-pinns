# Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for dynamic systems

This repo includes a series of physics-informed neural networks for various dynamic systems. The models and their development stage are shown in the below table. Please note, though some are noted as available and ready for use, they are in no way perfect. Please feel free to flag any bugs, or any possible improvements. The letters which define the development stage are:
 - A: Available
 - D: In development
 - P: Proposed
